## Features

- **Non-transferrable Tokens**: Tokens are "soulbound," meaning they cannot be transferred, traded, or approved for transfer.
- **Single Token per Address**: Each address is limited to holding at most one token.
- **Admin Roles**: Administrative roles enable controlled management of whitelists, blacklists, and contract settings.
- **Whitelist Functionality**: Can be toggled on or off to restrict whitelisted addresses minting themselves a token.
- **Blacklist Functionality**: Blacklisted addresses have their tokens burned (if any) and are excluded from minting and whitelisting.
- **Batch Operations**: Supports batch minting, whitelisting, blacklisting, and admin assignment for operational efficiency.

## Roles

There are five key roles in this system:

### Owner

- Can assign and revoke admin roles.
- Can set the contract URI for token metadata.

### Admins

- Can assign and revoke whitelisted and blacklisted roles.
- Can enable or disable the whitelist.
- Can mint tokens to addresses (subject to blacklist rules).
- Can pause and unpause `mintWithTerms(bytes)`.

### Whitelisted

- Can mint a token for themselves if the whitelist is enabled.

### Blacklisted

- Cannot be minted a token.
- If they previously held a token, it is burned upon blacklisting.
- If they were on the whitelist, they are removed from it upon blacklisting.

### Public Minters

- Can mint a token with `mintWithTerms()` if they sign a message containing the terms hash.

## Valid States

There are two valid states in this system:

### Whitelist Enabled

- Whitelisted accounts can mint a token for themselves.

### Whitelist Disabled

- Whitelisted accounts _cannot_ mint a token for themselves.

## Constructor/Deployment

When the `SoulBoundToken` contract is deployed, the following parameters must be provided:

- `name`: The name of the token (e.g., "SoulBoundToken").
- `symbol`: The symbol of the token (e.g., "SBT").
- `contractURI`: The contract URI for token metadata (e.g., "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<CID>/").
- `whitelistEnabled`: A boolean indicating whether the whitelist is initially enabled (`true`) or disabled (`false`).
- `nativeUsdFeed`: The address of the native/USD Chainlink price feed.
- `owner`: The address that becomes the owner of the contract.
- `admins`: An array of addresses given the admin role.

## External Functions

  - **Note**:
    - This could be a Terms of Service on IPFS.

## Usage

1. **Deployment**:

   - Deploy the contract with:
     - `name`: The token name (e.g., "SoulBoundToken").
     - `symbol`: The token symbol (e.g., "SBT").
     - `contractURI`: The contract URI for token metadata (e.g., "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<CID>/").
     - `whitelistEnabled`: Initial whitelist status (`true` or `false`).
     - `nativeUsdFeed`: The address of the native/USD Chainlink price feed.
     - `owner`: The address that becomes the owner of the contract.
     - `admins`: An array of addresses given the admin role.

2. **Owner Setup**:

   - Assign admin roles using `setAdmin` or `batchSetAdmin`.
   - Optionally, update the `contractURI` with `setContractURI`.

3. **Admin Actions**:

   - Manage the whitelist with `addToWhitelist`, `batchAddToWhitelist`, `removeFromWhitelist`, or `batchRemoveFromWhitelist`.
   - Manage the blacklist with `addToBlacklist`, `batchAddToBlacklist`, `removeFromBlacklist`, or `batchRemoveFromBlacklist`.
   - Toggle the whitelist status with `setWhitelistEnabled`.
   - Mint tokens using `mintAsAdmin` or `batchMintAsAdmin`.

4. **Whitelisted Users**:

   - If the whitelist is enabled, whitelisted users can call `mintAsWhitelisted` to mint a token for themselves.

5. **Other Users**:
   - Anyone can call `mintWithTerms(bytes)` to mint a token when the contract is not paused. They must provide a signature with the hash of the `contractURI()`, which can be obtained from `getTermsHash()` and their own address.

## Testing

Run `forge install` to install dependencies.

See coverage with `forge coverage` and `forge coverage --report debug`.

For unit tests run:

```
forge test --mt test_sbt
```

For invariant tests run:

```
forge test --mt invariant
```

## Formal Verification

This project uses [Certora](https://docs.certora.com/en/latest/) for formal verification.

To run the specification, first export your Certora prover key, and then run the configuration file:

```
export CERTORAKEY=<YOUR_KEY_HERE>
certoraRun ./certora/conf/SoulBoundToken.conf
```

A separate specification file is used for the `FeesAccountancy` invariant. This is because we needed to summarize the `_verifySignature()` logic in order to prevent the prover from auto havocing `onERC721Received()`. For some reason the full `_verifySignature()` causes the prover to havoc `onERC721Received()` even though we have used a dispatcher summary and included its implementation in our scene. To verify this invariant, run the following configuration:

```
certoraRun ./certora/conf/FeesAccountancy.conf
```

## Important Notes

- **Non-transferrable Tokens**: Tokens cannot be transferred. Attempts to call `transferFrom`, `approve`, or `setApprovalForAll` will revert with `SoulBoundToken__TransferNotAllowed` or `SoulBoundToken__ApprovalNotAllowed`.
- **Blacklisting Effects**: Adding an address to the blacklist burns any token they hold and removes them from the whitelist if applicable. Blacklisted addresses cannot be whitelisted or minted new tokens.
- **Token Limits**: Each address can hold at most one token. Attempts to mint to an address that already holds a token will revert with `SoulBoundToken__AlreadyMinted`.
- **Token IDs**: Token IDs start at 1 and increment sequentially with each mint.
- **Error Handling**: Functions include detailed revert conditions (e.g., zero address checks, duplicate status checks) to ensure robust and secure operation.
- **Zero Address Mints**: ERC721 reverts if mints are attempted to the zero address, so that functionality hasn't been explicitly added.

## Comments on Design Choices

- **Separate Add/Remove Functions**: Functions like `addToWhitelist` and `removeFromWhitelist` are separate rather than combined into a single `setWhitelist(address, bool)` function. This design choice prioritizes simplicity and readability over a more compact but less intuitive interface. The same applies to blacklist and batch equivalents.
- **Token ID Management**: The `_incrementTokenIdCounter` function optimizes storage reads and writes during batch minting.
- OpenZeppelin's Access control could replace the role management, but wouldn't make any difference in functionality or optimization

## Known Issues

- **Centralization risk** of admins/owner
- **Lack of zero address checks** on constructor args
  - _Justification_: saves a bit of gas and we won't be deploying with 0 address
- **Lack of empty array check** on admins array passed in constructor
  - _Justification_: saves a bit of gas and won't be deploying with empty array
- **Event emission for batch functions could possibly be optimised**, ie currently individual events are emitted per array item as opposed to a single event for an entire array
  - _Justification_: individual state changes are required for each array item anyway, so individual events isn't a _huge_ deal in terms of gas. It also makes reading indexed event params simpler, and it is not expected that batch functions will be used with ridiculously big arrays.

## Frontend Notes

### Libraries for connecting frontend to smart contract:

[ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/) - this is the most popular and probably the best option.

[web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.10.0/) - there's also this one if you have issues with ethers.

### What is needed?

- deployed SBT contract address
- probably rpc url for the blockchain network contract is deployed to
- contract ABI (application binary interface) - this is like a JSON file with information about the contract's functions and is created when the contract is compiled. I can find it later

### Non-admin/user mints

#### Fee

Users will have to pay a fee (if there is a fee) when minting a token. The fee can be retrieved from the contract's `getFee()` function (will return 0 if no fee) and should be passed as a `msg.value`.

Fees apply to both `mintAsWhitelisted()` and `mintWithTerms()`.

#### Signature

`mintWithTerms()` takes a signature as an argument. The signature must be unique to the user/msg.sender.

This is the logic in the contract for creating the signature:

```
/// @dev compute the message hash: keccak256(termsHash, msg.sender)
bytes32 messageHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(s_termsHash, msg.sender));

/// @dev apply Ethereum signed message prefix
bytes32 ethSignedMessageHash = MessageHashUtils.toEthSignedMessageHash(messageHash);
```

The value of `s_termsHash` can be retrieved from `getTermsHash()`, so you want to take that value and the user's address and create a hash of that using `keccak256(abi.encodePacked())` - ethers.js should be able to do this. Let me know if you need more information.

Then the hash that has been created with the `getTermsHash()` and user's address needs to be prefixed with a standard formatting thing for eth signatures. The logic in the library I've used looks like this:

```
keccak256(bytes.concat("\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n", bytes(Strings.toString(message.length)), message));
```

ethers.js should probably be able to do this too. Consider double checking this bit with AI.

### Fee Factor

The `setFeeFactor(uint256 newFeeFactor)` takes a uint256 `newFeeFactor` as an argument. This value is used to calculate the fee for minting. Solidity has no decimal places and 18 decimals is standardly used so if you want to set the fee to be $1 in value, use `1000000000000000000` (18 0's).

Similarly $0.50 would be `500000000000000000` (17 0's).

### getFee()

`getFee()` will also return a value with 18 decimal places, so if you are displaying the fee for a mint on the frontend, consider accounting for that. The currency will be in native/ETH.
